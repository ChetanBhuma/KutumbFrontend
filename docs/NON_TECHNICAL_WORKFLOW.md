# 🛡️ Kutumb: Senior Citizen Safety Portal - Workflow Overview

This document provides a **non-technical** guide to the Kutumb application. It explains how the system ensures the safety of senior citizens through a seamless connection between the community and the Delhi Police.

## 👥 The Key Players (Who is this for?)

The system revolves around three main participants:

1.  **👴 The Senior Citizen ("Grandpa/Grandma")**
    *   **Goal:** Wants to feel safe, connected, and have quick access to help in emergencies.
    *   **Action:** Registers on the portal, uses the SOS button, and receives visits.

2.  **👮 The Beat Officer (The "Feet on the Ground")**
    *   **Goal:** To know exactly who lives in their area and ensure they are safe.
    *   **Action:** Receives visit tasks, verifies citizens physically, and responds to alerts.

3.  **🏢 The Administrator (The "Supervisor")**
    *   **Goal:** To have a bird's-eye view of safety operations and manage resources.
    *   **Action:** Approves registrations, manages police station data, and monitors reports.

## 🔄 The Safety Journey: Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Joining the Family (Registration)

**Scenario:** A senior citizen, or their family member, decides to register for the Delhi Police Senior Citizen scheme.

1.  **Easy Sign-Up**: The citizen opens the web portal and fills out a simple form (Name, Age, Address, Blood Group, and Emergency Contacts).
2.  **Smart Sorting**: The system *automatically* detects which Police Station and "Beat" (neighborhood patrol area) the citizen lives in based on their address.
    *   *Why this matters:* No paperwork gets lost. The request goes straight to the correct local police station instantly.
3.  **Status**: The application is marked as **"Pending Review"**.

### Phase 2: Building Trust (Verification)

**Scenario:** The police need to confirm the citizen lives where they say they do.

1.  **Instant Alert**: The specific **Beat Officer** responsible for that street gets a notification on their phone/dashboard.
2.  **The Visit**: The officer visits the citizen's home. This is the first "human touchpoint."
3.  **Digital Verification**:
    *   The officer checks the ID documents.
    *   They take a photo of the citizen/location using the app.
    *   They click **"Verify"**.
4.  **Approval**: The Station House Officer (SHO) or Admin sees the verified report and clicks **"Approve"**.

### Phase 3: The Safety Net (Active Protection)

**Scenario:** The citizen is now a verified member of the Kutumb family.

1.  **Digital Identity**: The system generates a specialized **Digital ID Card** for the citizen. They can download it or show it on their phone.
2.  **Regular Care**: The system automatically schedules "Routine Visits" (e.g., every 15 days) for the Beat Officer. This ensures the police verify the citizen's well-being regularly, not just during emergencies.
3.  **🆘 Emergency Response**:
    *   If the citizen feels unsafe, they press the big red **SOS Button** on their dashboard.
    *   **Outcome:** The Control Room and the nearest Beat Officer get an instant alert with the citizen's live location.

## 🧠 Smart Features (The "Brain" of the System)

*   **Geofencing**: When an officer says "I visited the house," the system checks their GPS location to ensure they were actually there. This prevents fake reports.
*   **Auto-Allocation**: If an officer goes on leave, the system can re-assign their visits to another officer so no senior citizen is neglected.
*   **Jurisdiction Management**: Admins can easily draw or update boundaries (Zones, Ranges, Districts) so that every inch of the city is covered.

## ✅ Summary

In short, **Kutumb** replaces old paper files with a living, breathing digital connection. It turns a "registration" into an active, ongoing relationship between the Police and the Senior Citizens they serve.
